## My motivation

I've always been interested in computers. First, it was phones and tablets, then PCs, and now IoT and servers as well. Initially, I found most systems to be restrictive and limiting. I hated it when an important feature was missing or got removed for "security reasons." Then I learned that I have a different choice: I can change things however I want with the power of programming.

I started with Python but soon got bored with its simple syntax that hides the real complexity. After about a year had passed, I started again‚Äîthis time with C‚Äîin the spring of 2023. It was during school time, so I progressed slowly with the basics: writing a few "Hello World" programs and experimenting with escape sequences. As you can see, I really liked the possibilities of the Linux terminal's CLI.

I began taking C seriously during that summer break and learned a lot more about the language and computers in general. However, after going deeper with C, I didn't stop there.
I then began learning assembly. I first read the Assembly Language Step by Step, from Jeff Duntemann. Learning it in 2023 wasn't in vain, though. In the world of assembly, it's important to start with a bit of history: How today's modern systems are built can be traced back to how they were constructed in the early days.

My current portfolio consists mostly of unfinished projects, like my personal website and the previously mentioned RIG. For web development besides my simple website, I don't really like it, which is why I didn't wrote about it. It's buggy, messy, and inconsistent. I haven't even touched JavaScript frameworks, because I dislike the complexity and slow speed of most dynamic websites. I don't want to be a part of it.

If you want to collaborate on an interesting project or support what I'm doing, contact me through the social links on my GitHub profile or on my website (if I can finally finish it). Pull requests to my projects are also welcome. I have little time for my projects due to school related things.
