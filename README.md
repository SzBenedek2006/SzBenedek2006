# Hi! üëãüïäÔ∏è

## Who am I?
Just a curious person who happens to be a programmer too.

I don't care about opinions disguised as facts. Until something is proven, I won't believe it.

Why? That's why. The _why_ is always more interesting than the _what_.

## What will you find here?
- My website.
- My social links.
- My other projects, including a Random Image Generator (RIG) for Linux.
- Random stuff, that I won't even try to explain.

## Why am I doing this?
I was always interested in computers. First in phones and tablets, then PCs and now IoT and servers too. But I always found them so restrictive and limiting. I hated when an important feature is missing or got removed for "security reasons"... Then learned that I have a different choice. Everyone can make a change in this world, including me, so I started learning programming.

Started with python then got bored by it's simple sintax, hiding the real complexity. After about a year has passed, I started again, this time with C, in the spring of 2023. It was school time, so I just progressed slowly with the basics. Writing a few "Hello world" programs with a few experiments with escape sequences here and there. You can see, I really liked the possibilities of the Linux terminal's CLI.

I started taking C seriously in that year's summer break. I learned a lot more about the language and about computers in general. But you can imagine, after I found high level languages, like Python boring and complex, I didn't just stop with C.

I started learning x86 assembly from a book _(yes, the 32 bit variant)_. Learning it in 2023 wasn't useless though. In assembly land it is important to start with a bit of history. How today's modern systems are built, can be broken down to how they were built in the earlier days.

My current portfolio consists of a half-finished, but good looking website, and the previously mentioned RIG. I don't really have a project in assembly, maybe I will do one in the coming year. About web dev... Well I don't really like it, that's why I didn't mention it before. It's buggy, messy and inconsistent. The same thing does entirely different things in different parts of the website. I didn't even touch js frameworks, because I hate the complexity and the slow speed of most dynamic website. Anyway, that's enough about me. If you wan't to collaborate in an interesting project or wan't to support what I'm doing, contact me in the social links on my Github profile or on my website (if I can finally finish it). Also pull requests to my projects are welcome. I have little time for my projects besides school.
